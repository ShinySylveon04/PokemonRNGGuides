This is an explanantion of the different ways the RNG can be advanced and influenced in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. The preferred method to advance the RNG is using the Pokedex, though there are other methods should the Pokedex not be available.

## Character Movement

When the player's character is standing still, they will fidget and blink, which will advance the RNG. However, this doesn't advance the RNG very fast, so it is still possible to land on a target advance in places where the RNG is not advanced by anything else. For this reason upstairs of the player's house is recommended for eggs and mystery gifts since your character is the only event advancing the RNG there.

Bringing up the in-game menu will prevent the player's character from fidgeting. This can help reduce the number of rng calls made in noisy areas.

## NPCs

NPCs will advance the RNG even if you cannot see them on screen. Any place with NPCs present will advance the RNG, and the more NPCs the faster the RNG advances. For this reason, it is recommended to not be in an area with NPCs since the RNG can skip over your target advance.

In instances where the Pokedex is not available, having an area with many NPCs, such as towns, can help with advancing the RNG to reach your target advance. An example is for the starters since the nearby route and town can help with reaching higher advances quickly.

## Trainer Card

Opening the Trainer Card advances the RNG quickly.

## Pokedex

Using the Pokedex is the recommended way of advancing the RNG.

Scolling up and down while viewing Pokedex entries will advance the RNG quickly. Looking at Aipom's, Azelf's, or Munchlax's entries will advance the RNG even faster, if you have those available.
