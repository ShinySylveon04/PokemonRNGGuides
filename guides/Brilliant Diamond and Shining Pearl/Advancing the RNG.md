This is an explanantion of the different ways the RNG can be advanced and influenced in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. The preferred method to advance the RNG is using the Pokedex, though there are other methods should the Pokedex not be available.

## Character Movement

When the player character is standing still, they will fidget and blink, which will advance the RNG. However, this doesn't advance the RNG very fast, so it is still possible to land on a target advance in places where the RNG is not advanced by anything else. For this reason, upstairs of the player's house is recommended for eggs and mystery gifts since your character is the only event advancing the RNG there.

In addition, bringing up the in-game menu will prevent the player's character from fidgetting, but will not prevent blinks from advancing the RNG. This can help in areas with other events advancing the RNG by preventing extra RNG advances from fidgetting occuring.

## NPCs

NPCs will advance the RNG even if you cannot see them on screen. Any place with NPCs present will advance the RNG, and the more NPCs the faster the RNG advances. For this reason, it is recommended to not be in an area with NPCs since the RNG can skip over your target advance.

In instances where the Pokedex is not available, being in an area with many NPCs, such as towns, can help with advancing the RNG to reach your target advance. An example is for the starters since the nearby route and town can help with reaching higher advances quickly. Keep in mind though to account for the extra advances needed during cutscenes to not miss your target advance.

## Trainer Card

Opening the Trainer Card advances the RNG quickly, so make sure to close it in time for your target advance.

## Pokedex

Using the Pokedex is the recommended way of advancing the RNG. Viewing a Pokemon's dex entry and then scrolling up and down advances the RNG quickly. Also, looking at Aipom or Azelf's entry will advance the RNG if you have those available.
